dedication: >
  <em>panic</em> was selected for the 2020 New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival.
program_notes: >
  <em>panic</em> was recorded and produced within the recording studio of Penn State University.
  The sounds of many alarm and alert sounds such as an iPhoneâ€™s default ringtone and text tone
  were recorded and edited. For some people these raw sounds can cause anxiety or distress,
  however this piece seeks to conquer this stress by slowing down and manipulating these sounds
  to create an intense yet intimate soundscape.
