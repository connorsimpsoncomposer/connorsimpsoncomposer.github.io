  <em>Exile</em> seeks to recreate a musical moment of sadness and depression from the loss of a loved one.

  <em>Exile</em> does not represent anger, denial or the stages of grief, only depression. The text resonated with me deeply with my own processing of grief.

lyrics:
  - |
    By the sad waters of separation  
    Where we have wandered by divers ways,  
    I have but the shadow and imitation  
    Of the old memorial days.
  - |
    In music I have no consolation,  
    No roses are pale enough for me;  
    The sound of the waters of separation  
    Surpasseth roses and melody.
  - |
    By the sad waters of separation  
    Dimly I hear from an hidden place  
    The sigh of mine ancient adoration:  
    Hardly can I remember your face.
  - |
    If you be dead, no proclamation  
    Sprang to me over the waste, gray sea:  
    Living, the waters of separation  
    Sever for ever your soul from me.
  - |
    No man knoweth our desolation;  
    Memory pales of the old delight  
    While the sad waters of separation  
    Bear us on to the ultimate night.
