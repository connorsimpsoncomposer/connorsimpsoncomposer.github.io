lyrics: |
  who knows if the moon’s
  a balloon,coming out of a keen city
  in the sky—filled with pretty people?
  (and if you and i should

  get into it,if they
  should take me and take you into their balloon.
  why then
  we’d go up higher with all the pretty people

  than houses and steeples and clouds:
  go sailing
  away and away sailing into a keen
  city which nobody’s ever visited,where

  always
  it’s
  Spring)and everyone’s
  in love and flowers pick themselves
