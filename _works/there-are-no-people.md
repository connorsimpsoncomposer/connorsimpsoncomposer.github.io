program_notes: >
  <em>there are no people</em> explores feelings of loneliness in crowded places. The work questions the
  existence of the unknown people who decorate a city. Those who we will never meet and will never know us.

lyrics: |
  There are no people in the cars which drive by me.
  There are no people in the buildings I walk past.
  empty
  No
  Blank

  The sun beats down on empty mirrors,
  Empty mirrors filled with the sky.
  A beautiful, dying, unattainable expanse an armâ€™s length away.

  Something overflowing with nothing,
  Something which does not see me.

  An empty city crowded with no one,
  No one who comes from nowhere.
  No one who has no name.
  No one who I may never see again.
  In the reflection in the eyes of no one,
  I cannot see myself.
