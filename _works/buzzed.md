  <em>Buzzed</em> slows down and analyses the gestures of the sounds chosen for the piece and represents them  structurally. 
  The buzzing gesture controls the form of the piece, just as a coin rattles on a vibraphone, large attacks  occur throughout 
  the piece increasing in frequency by a constant ratio. Other sounds like rattles are represented by  randomly scattered 
  wooden attacks and the friction within an attack is represented by bowed techniques.
