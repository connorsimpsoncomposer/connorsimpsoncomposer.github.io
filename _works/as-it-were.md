  <em>As it were</em> explores a language of rhythmic and melodic combinations. The work exists as a canon,
    where a single melodic line is repeated and juxtaposed against itself. In this work, the canon is crafted to draw out a variety in the resultant rhythms between pairs of voices. In each of the two pairs, each of a unique series of rhythms are used without repetition. This results in an evolving landscape of counterpoint, where the relationship between each voice is constantly changing. The melodic material of the work gradually shifts closer together in each measure, slowly revealing the similarities within each line.
