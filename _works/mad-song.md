  <em>Mad Song</em> uses various extended techniques of the human voice, piano, and bass drum to create a sonic
  landscape for William Blake’s *Mad Song*. The sounds of the piece are used to represent Blake’s extensive use of

lyrics:
  - |
    The wild winds weep,  
    And the night is a-cold;  
    Come hither, Sleep,  
    And my griefs infold:  
    But lo! the morning peeps  
    Over the eastern steeps,  
    And the rustling birds of dawn  
    The earth do scorn.
  - |
    Lo! to the vault  
    Of paved heaven,  
    With sorrow fraught  
    My notes are driven:  
    They strike the ear of night,  
    Make weep the eyes of day;  
    They make mad the roaring winds,  
    And with tempests play.
  - |
    Like a fiend in a cloud  
    With howling woe,  
    After night I do croud,  
    And with night will go;  
    I turn my back to the east,  
    From whence comforts have increas'd;  
    For light doth seize my brain  
    With frantic pain.
