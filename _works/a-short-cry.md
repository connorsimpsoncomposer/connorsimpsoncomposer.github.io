  <em>A short cry</em> moves through restrained gestures and fading echoes, tracing fragments of half-remembered expression.
  Murmurs, brief intensities, and fragile lyricism drift without setting. A residue remains, of memory and loss.
  Sounds surface tentatively, like memories half-surfaced or voices softened by distance. What unfolds is quiet and porous â€” shaped not by structure, but by the erosion of presence.
