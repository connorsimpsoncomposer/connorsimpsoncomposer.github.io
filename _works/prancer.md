  <em>Prancer</em> explores the diatonic scale using various serial techniques. In the opening of the work,
  the scale is sounded harmonically, and its root is planed through a twelve-tone row. This twelve-tone row
  is also expressed rhythmically through the time-point system. A section then follows where the diatonic
  scale is transposed, using the same set of techniques, through the interval cycles. Following a metric
  modulation, the work recapitulates the opening section in both the new and previous timestreams. Then, at
  the quintal voicing of the scale, the heptachord is treated as a mod7 aggregate. Two soloists complete
  the heptachord over the pentachord provided by the ensemble. The work then ends with an original chorale.
  Alternatively, this work may be about the reindeer, Prancer.
