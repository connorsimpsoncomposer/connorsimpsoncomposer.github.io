dedication: Premiered by Haley Fennell 2019, in Esber Recital Hall.
program_notes: >
  <em>Broken Tongue</em> is based on three main ideas. Each one of these ideas consists of a collection of four pitches. The first two ideas are introduced immediately in their simplest state, whereas the third idea is only foreshadowed until measure 78. The piece experiments and builds upon these pitch collections gradually throughout the piece. As these ideas develop, the piece builds toward a climax only to end with a restatement of the pieceâ€™s beginning.
