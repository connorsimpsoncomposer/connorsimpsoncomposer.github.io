program_notes: >
  <em>Insufficient Title</em> slowly integrates scattered beatboxing sounds throughout the piece. These sounds grow closer as the piece moves on until finally the flute and marimba player beatbox in unison revealing that the scattered noises the listener heard throughout the piece were actually deconstructed beatboxing sounds.

  - Cara Gould, flute
  - Andrew Stern, marimba
