  <em>Misunderstandings</em> represents several rhythms being folded upon themselves with respect to time.
  However, this approach is flawed due to the composer’s own misunderstandings regarding the inversion of these rhythms.
  This misunderstanding is eloquently illustrated by Søren Kierkegaard.

  <p style="text-align: center;">
  “It is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards. But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards." - Søren Kierkegaard
