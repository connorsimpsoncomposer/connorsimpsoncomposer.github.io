program_notes: >
  <em>Something which wanders and falls</em> explores both modular and linear development
  of musical material through time. Within each section, each instrument presents as its
  own character within a dense texture. This texture is extended so that the listener
  may shift their focus to the various relationships between each character. Throughout
  these moments the pitch material evolves gradually, traversing a chain of each prime
  form heptachord. Then the texture suddenly thins and is interrupted by an abrupt
  change in orchestration, forcing the listener to grow accustomed to a new and
  unfamiliar sound world.
