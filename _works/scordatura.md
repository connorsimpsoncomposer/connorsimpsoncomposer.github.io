  <em>Scordatura</em> creates a microtonal soundscape through the detuning of the ensembleâ€™s valves.
  The work explores the physical phenomena of beating as well as harmonies found in just intonation
  and 24 tone equal temperament. Each tubist uses live electronics to provide themselves with tuning
  pitches throughout the work.
