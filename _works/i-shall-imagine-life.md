  Inspired by an E. E. Cummings poem of the same title,
  <em>i shall imagine life</em> reflects the complex breadth
  of experiences found within life. The piece was composed
  using a compositional system that used morse code to
  convert the text of the poem into the melodic material of
  the piece. The piece was designed to represent the
  language of the poem through this system, while painting
  the meaning of the poem through a complex and dynamic
  tone.
