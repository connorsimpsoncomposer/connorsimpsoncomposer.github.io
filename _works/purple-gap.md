program_notes: >
  <em>Purple Gap</em> explores a sustained, sentimental sonority. The piece opens freely.
  The opening harmony fades in softly and slowly. The piece begins to grow in speed and
  intensity until releasing into its most full and vibrant moment. The opening harmony then
  slowly fades away as the piece moves on.
