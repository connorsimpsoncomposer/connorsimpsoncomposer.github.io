dedication: >
  <em>The Memory of a Story</em> was written in Spring, 2022.
program_notes: >
  <em>The Memory of a Story</em> is not about any specific
  story, but rather the way in which we share our stories.
  Over time each story we tell changes. We learn which parts
  to exaggerate and what will get a laugh. We remember not
  just the story itself but the act of telling the story. With
  each telling, these stories become not just records of the
  past but new moments of connection.
