program_notes: >
  <em>ill</em> recounts a moment of anxiety. <em>ill</em> does not seek
  to inform others how they might recover from their own
  anxieties or even demonstrate how the composer dealt with
  their own anxieties. <em>ill</em> simply seeks to share a moment the
  composer found deeply hurtful.
