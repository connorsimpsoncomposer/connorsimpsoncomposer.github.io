    Connor’s music often draws from early music, threading faint traces of Renaissance harmony  
    and polyphony through delicate timbral landscapes. His work engages with the shifting presence of musical allusion 
    which evolves and refracts as each piece unfolds. These echoes bend and reframe, casting familiar murmurs in unexpected light,  
    where meaning and texture drift, and focus over time.

    Connor specializes in computer-assisted composition, building musical structures through algorithms, 
    discrete mathematics, and generative design. His creative practice integrates platforms like Python, 
    Max/MSP, and Mathematica to explore new models of form and transformation. As Events Manager for the 
    Electroacoustic Music Studios @ Eastman (EMuSE), he produced and engineered concerts of leading 
    electroacoustic works, managing and engineering multi-channel speaker arrays, live electronics and 
    sound reinforcement. These concerts included works by esteemed composers such as Helmut Lachenmann, 
    Kaija Saariaho, and Mario Davidovsky, and involved deep collaboration with Eastman ensembles including 
    OSSIA and Musica Nova. He previously served as a studio engineer at Penn State, recording sessions for 
    student and professional composers alike.

    Connor is also a dedicated educator, offering private lessons in composition and theory, with an emphasis 
    on professional development and artistic identity for emerging composers. At Eastman, he taught labs in electroacoustic 
    music, providing instruction in recording techniques, digital audio workstations, and music technology while guiding students 
    in applying these skills to their own compositions. He also served as Composition Coordinator for Penn 
    State’s Honors Music Institute, where he led group lessons and workshops in composition, orchestration, and music history.
